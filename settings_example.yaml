# This config has some optional fancy parsing options, that can be added after a '|' separator in the config entry name.
#
# The first option explicitly indicates the type of the entry (the default is str). 
# So far the following are supported:
# - int     (value will be read as int)
# - float   (value will be read as float)
# - ip      (value will be converted to namedtuple with str "ip" and int "port" fields, format is "ip:port", e.g. "192.168.0.1:5000")
# - path    (value will be converted to a pathlib Path object)
#
# The second option indicates the range, which currently only works for numerical types (float/int).
# The two values are separate by "...", with the left one being the lower limit and the right one being the upper.
